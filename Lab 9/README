CS2110                         Lab #09                       Fall 2017
======================================================================

(This lab is collaborative, so feel free to work with friends or TAs.)

Objective: To get comfortable with our Linux environment, and to 
           practice using the basic assembly instructions (such as 
           LEA, LD, LDR, LDI, ST, STR, STI, AND, ADD, BR).

You can find an appendix of basic assembly instructions by going to:
   T-Square> CS-2110 > Resources > Assembly Resources > PattPatelAppA.pdf
     
Focus on the program design process:
   1) Start with Pseudo-code
   2) Decide on a register-usage scheme
   3) Translate your psuedo-code into assembly one block at a time
   4) Test each block
   5) Debug
   6) Repeat steps 3-5 until your entire program is complete

Your Assignment:
================

We have provided you with two skeleton assembly file called "sumtorial.asm" and "sum.asm".

Included with the installation of complx is a program called lc3test, which
uses a set of test values defined in an XML file to test your LC3 code. To get
credit for this lab, you must implement the code in the provided template, then
use the provided XML test to see if your code is correct. 

Edit this file and turn in the following:

    1) First you will write an assembly program that adds two numbers and prints
    out the result. See more details in the sum.asm file. After writing and running
    your code in complx you can check your work by running:

    lctest sum.xml sum.asm

   2) Write an assembly program called "sumtorial.asm" that calculates the sumtorial of a given number.

      The "sumtorial" of a given number is very like the factorial of that number
         except that instead of multiplying you will add. 
      Factorial(n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1
      Sumtorial(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 2 + 1 

 Check that your code is correct by running:
        lctest sumtorial.xml sumtorial.asm

When you finish show a TA all your tests passing
